# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Thank you for helping us keep Mirukali secure. We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities you may find.

**Since the main repository for Mirukali is private, the primary channel for reporting security vulnerabilities is directly through our development team.**

**How to Report:**

Please do not publicly disclose security vulnerabilities. Instead, contact our development team directly via one of the following methods:

* **Direct Message to Project Administrators on Discord:** If you are a member of our Mirukali Discord server, please send a direct message to one of the project administrators or designated security team members. You can usually identify administrators by their roles within the server.
* **Email:** If you are not on our Discord server or prefer email, please send a detailed report to the following email address: [**[admin@alikuxac.xyz]**](mailto:admin@alikuxac.xyz)

**What Information to Include in Your Report:**

To help us investigate and address the vulnerability effectively, please include the following information in your report:

* **Detailed Description of the Vulnerability:** Explain the issue clearly and concisely.
* **Steps to Reproduce:** Provide specific steps that we can follow to reproduce the vulnerability.
* **Potential Impact:** Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data breach, unauthorized access, denial of service).
* **Affected Components:** Identify the specific parts of Mirukali that are affected (if known).
* **Your Contact Information:** Please provide a way for us to contact you if we need further information.
* **Any Supporting Evidence:** Include any relevant screenshots, code snippets, or other information that can help us understand the vulnerability.

**Our Commitment:**

* We will acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe.
* We will investigate the reported vulnerability promptly and take appropriate steps to address it.
* We will keep you informed of the progress of our investigation and remediation efforts, where appropriate.
* We appreciate responsible disclosure and will consider public recognition for valid security reports, where appropriate and with your consent.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have had a reasonable time to address it.**
* **Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability or access sensitive data.**
* **Act in good faith and provide us with the necessary information to resolve the issue.**

By following these guidelines, you help us maintain a secure environment for Mirukali and our community. Thank you for your cooperation.
